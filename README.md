### Overview
This is a collection of example modifications/extensions made to the Common Mapping Client. The hope
is to provide real code examples to demonstrate how to begin building new and awesome applications
using the tool. This is a learning tool so please don't hesitate to ask questions in the issues.

Each example resides on its own branch and includes an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file that describes
the files changed and why. You can then explore those files to see the actual code changes.
